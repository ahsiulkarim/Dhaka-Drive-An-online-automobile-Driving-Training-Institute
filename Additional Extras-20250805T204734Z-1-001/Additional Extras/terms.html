            <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
            <div class="terms-content">
                <p><strong>Last Updated: July 21, 2024</strong></p>
                <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") carefully before using the Dhaka Drive website and services.</p>

                <h2>1. Enrollment and Payment</h2>
                <p>By enrolling in a course, you agree to pay the specified fees. All fees are due as per the payment schedule outlined on your dashboard. We accept payments via Mobile Financial Services (MFS), Card, and Cash at our designated offices. Your enrollment is not confirmed until payment is successfully processed and approved by our administration.</p>

                <h2>2. Scheduling and Cancellation</h2>
                <p>Class scheduling is subject to instructor and vehicle availability. You can request a preferred schedule through your user dashboard, which we will do our best to accommodate. If you need to cancel or reschedule a class, you must provide at least 24 hours' notice. Failure to do so may result in the forfeiture of that class session.</p>

                <h2>3. Learner's Responsibilities</h2>
                <p>You must possess a valid learner's permit from the BRTA for all car and motorcycle courses, where applicable. You are required to carry your learner's permit and any other required identification (such as NID or Passport copy) with you during all practical training sessions. You must be in a fit state to drive, not under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or any medication that could impair your ability to operate a vehicle safely.</p>
                
                <h2>4. Code of Conduct</h2>
                <p>All students are expected to behave in a respectful and courteous manner towards instructors and fellow learners. Dhaka Drive reserves the right to terminate any training session or cancel an enrollment without a refund if a student's behavior is deemed unsafe, disruptive, or abusive.</p>

                <h2>5. Liability</h2>
                <p>Dhaka Drive provides modern, dual-control vehicles and certified instructors to ensure a safe learning environment. However, driving carries inherent risks. Dhaka Drive is not liable for any personal injury or property damage that occurs as a result of a student's negligence or failure to follow the instructor's directions.</p>

                <h2>6. Account Deactivation</h2>
                <p>You may request to deactivate your account from your user dashboard. Please note that deactivation is permanent. Dhaka Drive also reserves the right to deactivate any user account for violating these terms or for prolonged inactivity.</p>

                <h2>7. Changes to Terms</h2>
                <p>Dhaka Drive reserves the right to modify these Terms and Conditions at any time. We will notify users of any significant changes. Your continued use of our services after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
